These are the instructions to run the program

1)		Load 'trainedNet' workspace (You only need to do this once)

2.1)	Choose a sample image from folders boards_test or boards_test2
2.2)	Write the path to the image in the first line of the "run.mlx" file
2.3)	If you chose a file from boards_test, set variable "toRotate" to 0, if you chose an image from boards_test2, set it to 1.
		This is because MATLAB does not recognize image rotation information in the metadata. Phones use this data when you take a
		picture with different phone orientation to keep the image consistent with the phone frame of reference.

3)		Start the script 'run.mlx'. All intermediate results will be shown in the live script.
